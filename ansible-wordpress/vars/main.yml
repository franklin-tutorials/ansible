# vars file for ansible-wordpress role
# These variables override those in defaults/main.yml
# Example:
# wp_db_name: "my_custom_wordpress_db"

# OS-specific variables will be set here based on ansible_os_family
# This allows tasks to use generic variable names like 'apache_package_name'
# which will then be defined based on the detected OS.

# This file can also be used to store sensitive variables if not using Ansible Vault,
# though it's generally recommended to pass sensitive data via command-line --extra-vars
# or use Ansible Vault.

# For user/group, we'll set them based on OS family
# These are just illustrative; the actual setting happens in a task.
# _apache_user: "{{ 'www-data' if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else 'apache' }}"
# _apache_group: "{{ 'www-data' if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else 'apache' }}"

# Similarly for package names if not handled directly in tasks with conditionals
# _apache_package_name: "{{ apache_package_name_debian if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else apache_package_name_redhat }}"
# _php_package_names: "{{ php_package_names_debian if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else php_package_names_redhat }}"
# _mariadb_server_package_name: "{{ mariadb_server_package_name_debian if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else mariadb_server_package_name_redhat }}"
# _mariadb_client_package_name: "{{ mariadb_client_package_name_debian if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else mariadb_client_package_name_redhat }}"
# _apache_service_name: "{{ apache_service_name_debian if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' else apache_service_name_redhat }}"

# These specific variables will be defined in a task using set_fact
# to ensure they are correctly scoped and available for subsequent tasks.
# apache_user: "will_be_set_by_os_family"
# apache_group: "will_be_set_by_os_family"
# apache_package_name: "will_be_set_by_os_family"
